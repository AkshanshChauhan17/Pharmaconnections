          <p>
            In the summer of 2015, after completing my masterâ€™s degree in Life
            Science, I embarked on a challenging journey in search of a job
            within the pharmaceutical industry. To my dismay, every single
            company I approached greeted me with rejection. This frustrating
            experience forced me to introspect and realize that something within
            me needed to change in order to break through this seemingly
            impenetrable barrier.
          </p>
          <p>
            After careful analysis and extensive research on the prevailing
            market conditions, I began to pinpoint the factors contributing to
            my numerous rejections. It was at this moment of clarity that I
            resolved to enhance my skillset to align with the current demands of
            the industry.
